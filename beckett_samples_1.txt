there was a happy land

the American Bar

in Rue Mouffetard

there were red eggs there

I have a dirty I say henorrhoids

coming from the bath

my clit says it is necessary

it is necessary

it is vital

it is the last of its kind

on the outside looking in

the flower of the morning

shewing her young

all is not left of her

whence like the arbor of StÃ¼rmers

the underbelly of the steepled rags

my stella rister

shewing her young

all is not left of her

whence like the cork of a dying tree

the only precious thing

that may not be

used again



whence like the claw of a forgotten button

slouching up to a fork

the pressure of which is so great that no one can lift it

pestling the eye

all is not lost



whence like the pentacle of the claw

whey of willows symostat

it is so easy now

to lift

the travesty of lifting

the eye of God in the earth

the tonic of pride in the breasts

sagging rapidly like a sandal

shewing her young

all is not left of her

whence like the pentacle of the claw

whey of willows symostat

it is so easy now

to lift

the travesty of lift

the eye of God in the earth

the beauty of her radiant back

all is not left of her

whence like the pentacle of the claw

whey of willows symostat

it is so easy now

to lift

the travesty of lift

the eye of God in the earth

the beauty of her radiant back

all is not left of her

whence say no to me





asylum under my tread

among the lilies

and the clovers

my life strippin' she is making use

of the lock

the pocket of the raggedy fern

she is making use of the corner

the stork she is straining

to get on her feet

she is afraid she will break

she is afraid she will snap

I find me more at ease under the tree

than under the rose

than under the rose-glitter

I surprise me even more by discovering me

so brief than when I was born



my stork, she pities him

she thinks she is beautiful,

so rich he forgets she is worth

he takes her for a loan,

a present from when

the platform yellow with the incandescence of a dream

and the eyes redolent of sulphur

with a hint of pride

they will return with a vengeance

with their money, their glory and their splinters

a big fat pen and paper charging

million and one for a pederast

all the livelong way this day of sweet showers from Portrane on the seashore

Donabate sad swans of Turvey Swords

pounding along in three ratios like a sonata

like a Ritter with pommelled scrotum atra cura on the step

Botticelli from the fork down pestling the transmission

tires bleeding voiding zeep the highway

all heaven in the sphincter

mÃ¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¿Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¿Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼de now

potwalloping now through the promenaders

this trusty all-steel this super-real

bound for home like a good boy

where I was born with a pop with the green of the larches

ah to be back in the caul now with no trusts

no fingers no spoilt love

belting along in the meantime clutching the bike

the billows of the nubile the cere wrack

potwalloping now through the promenaders

this trusty all-steel this super-real

here at your feet

soaking up the spoilt Hovis

in your wine

soaking up the tattered sky

in your prayers

that nothing but the wind

tosses the bag and you are out of the way

quickening now through the thick of it

all the while dragging yourself like a good boy

with the bag you left it there

with your bag you went to bed

this day Spy Wedsday seven pentades past

it is raining on the border let it be

so I and all the rest go find a local

the mackerel are at billiards there they are crying the scores

the Barfrau makes a big impression with her mighty bottom

Dortmunderbuss is at billiards there she is crying the scores

the Weans is there she is sobbing

she is hooked on the Vals peering through the many achida

on her stinking old navy hat

it is time to go find her

she is not at all glad she has left us

she is so happy she has left us

she is ready she has got a box of tissues

a box full of pentades

pestling the eyes

sustaining the game the lads are there

jacks off on a motorcycle speeding past

it is time to go find her

she is not at all glad she has left us

she is so happy she has left us

No I believe every word of it I assure you.



The green of seta hurls itself directly at us.



No matter, let it pass.



Weâ€™re undone,

To think we were all this evening

Are you not a believer?

To believe in a means

of knowing and loving and comforting

that does not lead to confusion or to despair

and to love loving and caring

that does not lead to damnation.

tired of his cave-mind,

his lamp a pia depais of the old heart surgeonâ€™s mark

clot of clay placed under his breath.



Then for miles only wind

and the weals creeping alongside on the water

and the world opening up to the east

across a travesty of champaign to the mountains

and the stillborn evening turning a filthy green

manuring the night fungus

wrecked like a stone out from the start.



I splashed past a little wearish old man,

Democritus,

scuttling along between a crutch and a stick,

his stump caught up horribly, like a claw, under his breech, smoking.

Then because a field on the left went up in a sudden blaze

of shouting and urgent whistling and scarlet and blue ganzies

I stopped and climbed the bank to see the game.

A child fidgeting at the gate called up:

â€˜Would we be let in Mister?â€™

â€˜Certainlyâ€™ I said â€˜you would.â€™

But, afraid, he set off down the road.

â€˜Wellâ€™ I called after him â€˜why wouldnâ€™t you go on in?â€™

â€˜Wellâ€™ I said because I thought the same thing at first.â€™

But, as always, I got the better of them.

They put a damper on it with a damper on the road.

the light fails it shall go on

in our hearts it peals in our eyes

it peals out of us it shatters free will it rouses,

a ragged bag writhes,

it stinks,

it hurts,

it stinks,

it hurts not me I will cure it.

By this way succour and favour we are led.

Gracieuse and Fabius come in.

They are champions of Légno they are heroes of Portrane they are heroes of Turvey they are heroes of the Adriatic they are heroes of the Black Sea.

They are filled with pride,

with a hint of loathing,

a hint of awe,

a hint of surprise.

Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on!

Through these lips we may sing,

Let it be known that she is not she there.

She is caught up in the whirlwind,

in her confusion after she has fallen,

She is ruined,

in her perfect beauty,

shining round like an ocean star in the centre of her beauty

the first to perceive her beauty,

the last to silence her […]

She is my copy and your copy and mine only

and the only one I have.

out from the doomed land their reefs of tresses

in a hag she drops her young

the whales in Blacksod Bay are dancing

the asphodels come running the flags after

she thinks she is dying she is ashamed



she took me up on to a watershed

whence like the rubrics of a childhood

behold Meath shining through a chink in the hills

posses of larches there is no going back on

a rout of tracks and streams fleeing to the sea

kindergartens of steeples and then the harbour

like a woman making to cover her breasts

sidling up to their snares

the fairy-tales of Meath ended
