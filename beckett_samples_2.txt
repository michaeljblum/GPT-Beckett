Yoke of Liberty




The lips of her desire are grey

and parted like a silk loop

threatening

a slight wanton wound.

She preys wearily

on sensitive wild things

proud to be torn

by the grave crouch of her beauty.

But she will die and her snare

tendered so patiently

to my tamed watchful sorrow

will break and hang

in a pitiful crescent.





Antipepsis




And the number was uneven

In the green of holy Stephen

Where before the ass the cart

Was harnessed for a foreign part.

In this should not be seen the sign

Of hasard, no, but of design,

For of the two, by common consent,

The cart was the more intelligent.

Whose exceptionally pia

Mater hatched this grand idea

Is not known. He or she,

Smiling, unmolested, free,

By this one act the mind become

A providential vacuum,

Continues still to stroll amok,

To eat, drink, piss, shit, fart and fuck,

Assuming that the fucking season

Did not expire with that of reason.

Now through the city spreads apace

The cry: A thought has taken place!

A human thought! Ochone! Ochone!

Purissima Virgo! Weâ€™re undone!

Bitched, buggered and bewilderÃ¨d!

Bring forth your dead! Bring forth your dead!

At any rate, as we went down the main road, through the green of hope and reason,

biding our time without rancour or favour;

without second thoughts or protests.

Next:

a lamentable family of grey verminous hens,

perishing out in the sunk field,

trembling, half asleep, against the closed door of a shed,

with no means of roosting.

The great mushy toadstool,

green-black,

oozing up after me,

soaking up the tattered sky like an ink of pestilence,

in my skull the wind going fetid,

the water â€¦



Next:

on the hill down from the Fox and Geese into Chapelizod

a small malevolent goat, exiled on the road,

remotely pucking the gate of his field;

the Isolde Stores a great perturbation of sweaty heroes,

in their Sunday best,

come hastening down for a pint of nepenthe or moly or half and half

from watching the hurlers above in Kilmainham.



Blotches of doomed yellow in the pit of the Liffey;

the fingers of the ladders hooked over the parapet,

soliciting;

a slush of vigilant gulls in the grey spew of the sewer.



Ah the banner

the banner of meat bleeding

on the silk of the seas and the arctic flowers

that do not exist.

To make things worse, she was with us as well as behind the counter of the old house.

She was full of herself and of gladness.

She was afraid.



She held out her hand towards the city and the sea and the mountains and the sky.

Then she would stop and hug her child and hug the pin through her heart.

Then she would put her trust in the starlight and kiss the soil.

Then she would put her trust in the magic of the ballet and the wave and the greetings and the sing-alongs.

Then she would put her trust in the silence of the little black and white and the life of the noblest and most perfect singer.

She took the step she did because she was afraid.

She took the step she did because she was sad.

She took the step she did because she was happy.

No matter, leave her.

this is the impression I get

when I find out who she is

she is Iâ€™m sure you did

but you did not find out

until you were there

it was the autumn of your life

you were so loved there

that you forgot you were there

you loved her there so much you forgot you were there

you loved her so much you got used to her

she loved him there so damn him away

it was a terrible mistake

he was afraid of the dog

he loved her so much he went on

playing fetch with his ladders

saying again and again

if he did not love her he would not love her

if he did not love her he would not love her

if he did not love her he would not love her



at Parnell Road

a gravely wounded Ritter was stopped

and asked

why not go on in the meantime

going by the signpost

next to the canal

and signpost again

asking why not

on the other end of the canal

and signpost

still another four or five more

or six more on the bonnet

and say go on

if you do not go on in the meantime

you shall never be found

this clonic earth



is where the earth comes in

where the whales eat the fish

the gold in the gold in the harbour

the eyes the light the glory

it all boils down to blood of lamb

and the blessed lamb of her who has no need of it

and the lamb of her begging

who has no need of it and is not loved

by it and does not love it



this clonic earth

and the blessed lamb of her who has no need of it

and the lamb of her begging

who has no need of it and is not loved





Sanies IV




this clonic earth



is where the wind comes in

the clear hot summer sky

that ghost-forsakenowsenshes away

at the foot of the hill

sucking in my dirty clothes

my skinny pale infant tightrope

shivering in the sun

it is useless to move

I will not allow you in

on the crags below
